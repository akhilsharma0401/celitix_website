As businesses grow, their communication needs often expand across multiple teams, departments, regions, or brands.

WhatsApp Business API is linked to a phone number, not directly to a business entity. This means a single business can register multiple phone numbers under the same Meta Business Manager or across multiple Business Managers, depending on the use case.
Each phone number represents a separate WhatsApp Business API account with its own messaging limits, templates, and quality rating.

It is the name customers see when they receive a message from your business on WhatsApp. A clear and compliant display name helps build trust, improves brand recognition, and ensures smooth approval during onboarding.
    To maintain a secure and transparent messaging environment, WhatsApp has defined specific guidelines that businesses must follow when choosing a display name.`,

    sections: [
      {
        question: "Compliance with WhatsApp Policies",
        answer: `All display names must comply with WhatsApp’s Business and Commerce policies. The name should not contain misleading information, restricted terms, or promotional language.

        question: "Accurate and Clear Representation of Your Business",
        answer: `Your display name should accurately represent your business and clearly identify who you are.

        question: "BEST PRACTICES FOR HIGH TEMPLATE APPROVAL RATE",
        answer: `Getting your WhatsApp message templates approved by Meta is a critical step in using the WhatsApp Business API effectively. Since templates are reviewed to prevent spam and ensure a good user experience, following the right practices can significantly improve your approval rate. Below are some proven best practices to help your templates get approved faster and with fewer rejections.
    
    Start with a clear and specific purpose. The first line of your template should clearly explain why you are messaging the user—whether it’s an order update, appointment reminder, or service alert. Vague or misleading messages often get rejected because they appear promotional or spam-like.
    
    Always use simple, professional language. Avoid exaggerated marketing terms such as “Buy now,” “Limited offer,” or “Hurry up” unless the template is explicitly promotional and allowed. Proofread your content carefully, as spelling or grammatical errors can negatively impact approval.
    
    Follow proper formatting rules. Use variables correctly (e.g., {{1}}, {{2}}) with proper spacing and context. Each variable should add value and must not be placed randomly or on separate lines. Incorrect variable usage is one of the most common reasons for rejection.
    
    Ensure policy compliance at all times. WhatsApp does not allow threatening language, misleading claims, or requests for sensitive personal data such as OTPs, card details, or passwords through non-OTP templates. Your message should always feel safe and respectful to the recipient.
    
    Include a clear opt-out option in the footer, such as “Reply STOP to unsubscribe.” This shows that your business respects user consent and aligns with Meta’s messaging guidelines.
    
    Lastly, match the language selection with your content. Submitting English content under another language category—or mixing languages—will result in rejection.

    intro: `WhatsApp follows a strict opt-in policy to protect users from unwanted or spam communication. For businesses using the WhatsApp Business API, obtaining clear and valid user consent is mandatory before sending any messages. Understanding what Meta allows—and what it doesn’t—helps businesses stay compliant and maintain a healthy quality rating.`,
    sections: [
      {
        question: "What Meta Allows",
        answer: `Meta allows businesses to message users only after they have explicitly opted in. Opt-in can be collected through multiple channels such as website forms, mobile apps, WhatsApp chat widgets, SMS, email, IVR calls, or in-store QR codes. The opt-in request must clearly mention that the user is agreeing to receive messages on WhatsApp from your business.
    
   Consent should be explicit and informed. This means the user must knowingly take an action, such as ticking a checkbox or sending a keyword like “START” on WhatsApp. The opt-in message should also specify the type of messages the user will receive—such as order updates, reminders, or promotional alerts.
    
    Meta also allows businesses to re-engage users within the 24-hour customer service window after the user sends a message, without requiring a template.`,
      },
      {
        question: "What Meta Does NOT Allow",
        answer: `Meta strictly prohibits implied or automatic opt-ins. purchasing a product, sharing a phone number, or agreeing to general terms and conditions does not count as valid WhatsApp consent. Pre-checked boxes and hidden opt-in language are also not allowed.
    
        Sending messages to scraped, purchased, or third-party contact lists is a direct violation of WhatsApp policies. Businesses are also not allowed to continue messaging users who have opted out or blocked the business.
    
        Additionally, opt-ins collected for one brand or purpose cannot be reused for another brand or unrelated communication.`,

        question: "Why Opt-In Compliance Matters",

        answer: `Chatbots on WhatsApp are redefining how businesses engage, convert, and retain customers. With the WhatsApp Business API powered by Celitix, brands can turn everyday conversations into high-impact marketing and support experiences.
    
   WhatsApp chatbots works by instantly responding to customer messages using intelligent automation. When a user sends a message, the chatbots analyzes it to understand intent—such as product inquiries, pricing requests, booking confirmations, or support needs. Based on this, the chatbots delivers personalized, relevant responses in real time.

Using interactive buttons, lists, and smart flows, businesses can lead users toward actions like browsing products, capturing leads, booking demos, making payments, or completing purchases—without leaving WhatsApp.
    
    Chatbots also enable hyper-personalized marketing. By integrating with CRMs and backend systems, chatbots can use customer data to send targeted messages, product recommendations, reminders, and follow-ups at the right moment. This significantly improves open rates, engagement, and conversions compared to traditional channels like email or SMS.
    
    Another major advantage is 24/7 availability. AI chatbots ensure instant responses at any time, eliminating delays and keeping customers engaged throughout their buying journey.

Powered by the WhatsApp Business API, AI WhatsApp chatbots enable real-time, personalized communication at scale. With Celitix WhatsApp Business API and Chatbots Builder, businesses can easily design, deploy, and manage intelligent WhatsApp chatbots without complex coding.
    
   Chatbots on WhatsApp work using a visual chatbots flow builder. Businesses can create automated journeys by connecting different nodes such as text messages, images, videos, lists, buttons, CTAs, documents, and flows. These nodes guide customers step by step, making conversations simple, interactive, and action-driven.
    
   A chatbots journey usually starts with starting keywords like hi, testing or how can we help? . Once triggered, the chatbots responds instantly and uses AI and predefined logic to understand customer intent. Based on the response, users are guided through interactive lists and flows, helping them browse services, share details, or take the next action without manual support.
    
    Celitix also allows businesses to create multiple WhatsApp bots for different use cases such as customer service bots, lead generation bots, or industry-specific bots. All bots can be managed from a single dashboard under Manage Bots, making operations smooth and scalable.
    
    For complex queries, AI chatbots support agent handover, seamlessly transferring conversations to a live agent when human assistance is required. This ensures a perfect balance between automation and personalized support.

      {
        question: "Whatsapp Automation Vs Manual Messaging ",
        answer: `WhatsApp has become a primary communication channel for businesses, making it essential to choose between WhatsApp automation and manual WhatsApp messaging. Understanding the difference helps businesses improve customer engagement, reduce response time, and scale operations efficiently.
    
 Manual WhatsApp messaging relies on human agents to reply to customer queries individually. While it allows personalized conversations, it comes with major limitations. Response delays, limited working hours, high manpower costs, and inconsistent messaging often impact customer experience. Manual messaging may work for small businesses with low query volumes, but it becomes difficult to manage as customer interactions grow.
    
    WhatsApp automation, powered by the WhatsApp Business API, enables businesses to automate conversations using AI chatbots and predefined flows. Automated WhatsApp chatbots can instantly respond to FAQs, share order status, send OTPs, collect leads, schedule appointments, and trigger notifications—24/7 without human intervention. This result in faster response times, improved customer satisfaction, and reduced operational costs.
    
    From a scalability perspective, WhatsApp automation clearly outperforms manual messaging. Automated systems can handle thousands of conversations simultaneously, ensuring consistent messaging and seamless customer journeys. Businesses can also integrate WhatsApp automation with CRM systems, payment gateways, and backend platforms to enable WhatsApp marketing automation, customer support automation, and sales automation.
    
    Importantly, WhatsApp automation does not eliminate human interaction. With features like agent handover, complex or sensitive queries can be transferred to live agents at any stage of the conversation. This hybrid approach combines automation efficiency with a human touch.
    
    In conclusion, while manual WhatsApp messaging may suit limited use cases, WhatsApp automation is the smarter choice for growing businesses. By adopting automated WhatsApp solutions, businesses can increase engagement, boost conversions, and deliver a superior customer experience on the world’s most popular messaging platform.`,

    title: "What Are WhatsApp Template Messages?",
    intro: `WhatsApp Template Messages are pre-approved message formats that businesses use on the WhatsApp Business API to send messages to customers outside the 24-hour customer service window. Since WhatsApp is a personal communication channel, Meta requires businesses to get these messages approved in advance to ensure relevance, clarity, and policy compliance.
    
    In simple terms, whenever a business wants to initiate a conversation or reconnect with a customer after 24 hours, it must use a WhatsApp template message.`,
    sections: [
      {
        question: "Why WhatsApp Template Messages Are Required",
        answer: `WhatsApp enforces strict rules to protect users from spam and unwanted communication. Template messages act as a safeguard by ensuring that all outbound business messages follow Meta’s content guidelines and are sent only to users who have provided explicit opt-in consent.
        
        This approval-based system helps maintain message quality and builds trust between businesses and customers. Once approved, a template can be reused multiple times without requiring repeated approvals, making it suitable for automation and large-scale messaging.`,
      },
      {
        question: "How WhatsApp Template Messages Work",
        answer: `Businesses submit their message content to Meta for review through their WhatsApp Business API provider. During the review process, Meta checks the wording, intent, and compliance with WhatsApp policies. Approved templates are assigned a unique name and can then be triggered through APIs, chatbots, or campaign tools.
        
        Templates also allow limited personalization using placeholders; ensuring messages remain consistent while still feeling relevant to the recipient.`,
      },
      {
        question: "Key Benefits for Businesses",
        answer: `WhatsApp template messages help businesses deliver important information reliably and on time. They improve message deliverability, reduce the risk of account restrictions, and enable seamless communication workflows. Because templates follow a fixed and approved format, they are less likely to be flagged or rejected, ensuring smooth message delivery.`,
      },
      {
        question: "Conclusion",
        answer: `WhatsApp Template Messages are essential for compliant business communication on WhatsApp. They allow businesses to proactively reach customers in a controlled, trusted, and scalable manner, making them a foundational element of any WhatsApp Business API strategy.`,

    title: "Key Points While Drafting WhatsApp Business Message Templates",
    sections: [
      {
        question: "Key Points While Drafting WhatsApp",
        answer: `Drafting effective WhatsApp Business message templates is crucial for approval, delivery, and customer engagement. Since these templates are reviewed by Meta before use, even small mistakes in wording or formatting can lead to rejection. Keeping a few best practices in mind can significantly improve approval rates and message performance.
        
        One proven approach is to start your message with a polite and contextual opening line such as “Thanks for your enquiry” or “Thanks for registering for our event.” Such openings immediately establish relevance and make the message feel expected rather than promotional. This approach has consistently worked well for many WhatsApp Business API users.
        
        Formatting plays an important role in making templates more engaging. WhatsApp allows the use of bold, italics, and ~strikethrough~ text within templates. When used correctly, formatting helps highlight key information and improves readability. However, incorrect or broken formatting can cause template rejection, so it’s important to follow WhatsApp’s text rules carefully.
        
        Emojis are another effective way to personalize templates and make them feel more conversational. When used in moderation, emojis can improve open rates and make messages appear friendly and human. Overusing emojis, however, may negatively impact approval or customer perception, so balance is essential.
        
        WhatsApp also allows businesses to add Call-to-Action (CTA) or Quick Reply buttons to templates. These buttons help users take immediate action, such as visiting a website or confirming an update. Each button has a strict character limit of 20 characters, so the text must be short, clear, and action-oriented.
        
        While adding links, businesses must ensure they use full and valid URLs. URL shorteners are not allowed in WhatsApp templates and often result in rejection. Always use trusted and clearly identifiable links.
        
        In conclusion, well-drafted WhatsApp message templates combine polite language, clean formatting, thoughtful personalization, and strict compliance with WhatsApp guidelines. Following these key points helps ensure faster approvals, better engagement, and smoother communication with customers.`,
